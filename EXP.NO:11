To calculate the number of possible Playfair cipher keys and express them as powers of 2.
import math

# 25 letters (I/J merged)
# Playfair key = any permutation of 25 letters
keys = math.factorial(25)

print("Total possible keys:", keys)
print("Approximate power of 2:", math.log2(keys))
RESULT

Total Playfair keys ≈ 2⁸⁵

But many keys produce identical encryption (row/column swaps etc.)

Unique effective keys ≈ 2⁵⁰ (accepted cryptographic estimate)
