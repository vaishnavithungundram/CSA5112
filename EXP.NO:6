AIM
To break an affine cipher by analyzing the most frequent ciphertext letters and calculating the key values a and b, then decrypting the ciphertext.
# Affine Cipher Decryption

# Function to find modular inverse
def mod_inverse(a, m):
    for x in range(1, m):
        if (a * x) % m == 1:
            return x
    return None

def affine_decrypt(ciphertext, a, b):
    a_inv = mod_inverse(a, 26)
    plaintext = ""

    for ch in ciphertext:
        if ch.isalpha():
            C = ord(ch.upper()) - 65
            P = (a_inv * (C - b + 26)) % 26
            plaintext += chr(P + 65)
        else:
            plaintext += ch

    return plaintext


# Derived from frequency analysis:
a = 3
b = 15

cipher = input("Enter ciphertext: ")
plain = affine_decrypt(cipher, a, b)

print("Decrypted text:", plain)
RESULT

The affine cipher was successfully broken using frequency analysis, and the plaintext was recovered using the calculated keys a = 3 and b = 15.
